Short answers for the below questions suffice. If you want to alter your plan for your project (and obtain approval for the same), be sure to email your section leader directly!

#### What have you done for your project so far?

I've created a main.lua file for love. I have also created the window which is my game. I've coded the screen moving.

#### What have you not done for your project yet?

I haven't created the wall, characters, or enemies.

#### What problems, if any, have you encountered?

My lua didn't originally work, my love also didn't work. I realized I had to install them both. I had to download different software as I didn't origingally understand. I then got through those and then got stuck as the CS50 course doesn't provide the correct spritesheet. So I am stuck.
